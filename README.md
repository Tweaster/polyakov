Polyakov
======


## About
Hi my name is [Fabrice Rasoamiaramanana](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/frasoamiaramanana) and here is a Theme I have developped for [Dropplets](http://dropplets.com). I named this theme after [Alexander Markovich Polyakov](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alexander_Markovich_Polyakov) (Алекса́ндр Ма́ркович Поляко́в) a Russian physicist who brought a significant contribution to the field of Quantum Physics. This theme however has nothing to do with Quantum Physics but I thought that `Polyakov` sounded like a good name so there you go!

##Installation
Just copy the `Polyakov` folder into your `templates` folder, then select it from the list of installed templates in your dropplets menu.
